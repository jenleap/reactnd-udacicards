# Udacicards

A mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. Users can create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

It is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course.

This app has been tested for Android.  

### Install

Clone the GitHub repository, then install and launch:

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/jenleap/reactnd-udacicards
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
```

Once the app has started, follow the instructions for your device or emulator of choice.
